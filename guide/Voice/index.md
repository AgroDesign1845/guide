# Voice
Welcome to the guide for Voice features in Pycord.
Note: This guide will expect you to have already have experience with the library.

## Requirements
The only requirement needed for voice is [`PyNaCl`](https://pypi.org/project/PyNaCl/), and all others here will be optional.

  - [`FFmpeg`](https://ffmpeg.org) used for sending/receiving files other than `.pcm` and `.wav`
  - [`Pycord.Wavelink`](https://github.com/Pycord-Development/Pycord.Wavelink), [`Lavalink.py`](https://github.com/Devoxin/Lavalink.py), [`Wavelink`](https://github.com/PythonistaGuild/Wavelink) or anyother python lavalink lib for music playing.
