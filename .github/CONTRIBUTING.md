# Contributing
First of all thank you for getting this far, and second this isn't really a comprehensive list of the do's/don'ts 
more of an faq which quickly should cover anything.

# Commits
when doing commits don't use past tense like `fixed a bug` more do `fix a bug`.

# Contributions
when making a contribution you agree that we are allowed to put **your** contribution under our license.
