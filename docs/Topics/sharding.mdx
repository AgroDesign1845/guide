# Sharding
Sharding in Pycord is straight forward and simplistic,

:::tip When to Shard?

It is recommended to only shard your bot when it reaches 2,000 or more servers. Anything under this will not do anything and consume unnecessary resources. 
Discord itself will let you know when it's time for sharding. 

:::

Just replace your `discord.Client`, `discord.Bot`, `commands.Bot` objects
with `discord.AutoShardedClient`, `discord.AutoShardedBot`, `commands.AutoShardedBot` respectively.

If you want to specify the amount of shards your bot uses, 
just add the `shards` parameter, along with the amount of shards you want.
