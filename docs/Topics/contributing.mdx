# About
This section outlines some syntaxing when making the guide,
for contributing rules look [here](https://github.com/Pycord-Development/guide/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md)

## Notes and warnings

Markdown syntaxing in docusaurus is pretty advanced but in no way hard,
it's just as simple as:
```
:::note
did you know of girrafe?
:::

:::danger
your stepping into the danger zone
:::

:::tip
my hat
:::
```
:::note
did you know of girrafe?
:::

:::danger
your stepping into the danger zone
:::

:::tip
my hat
:::

to make these have custom titles just add the title next to it, like so:
```
:::note Harambe
An animal know for well uhhhh
:::
```
:::note Harambe
An animal known for well uhhhh
:::

## Discord Message Components
As most files already have the imports for these, it's not that hard to add them,
the div starts like so:

```
<DiscordMessages>

</DiscordMessages>

<br />
```
of which you list `DiscordMessage`'s, like so:

```
<DiscordMessages>
    <DiscordMessage author="Guide Bot" avatar="red">
        hello obi wan kenobi
    </DiscordMessage>
</DiscordMessages>

<br />
```
<DiscordMessages>
    <DiscordMessage author="Guide Bot" avatar="red">
        hello obi wan kenobi
    </DiscordMessage>
</DiscordMessages>

<br />

it is a pretty easy and straight forward syntax.

### Slash Commands
To make a message authored by a slash command, do the following:

```
<DiscordMessages>
    <DiscordMessage author="Guide Bot" avatar="red">
        <div slot="interactions">
            <DiscordInteraction author="Davey" avatar="Green" command>davey</DiscordInteraction>
        </div>
        DAVEYYYY
    </DiscordMessage>
</DiscordMessages>

<br />
```
<DiscordMessages>
    <DiscordMessage author="Guide Bot" avatar="red">
        <div slot="interactions">
            <DiscordInteraction author="Davey" avatar="Green" command>davey</DiscordInteraction>
        </div>
        DAVEYYYY
    </DiscordMessage>
</DiscordMessages>

<br />

remember to always have `<br />` at the end of the components.

### Buttons
To add a button to a message do so:

```
<DiscordMessages>
    <DiscordMessage author="Guide Bot" avatar="red" bot>
        <div slot="interactions">
            <DiscordInteraction author="Guide Man" avatar="green" command>button</DiscordInteraction>
        </div>
        button go brrr
        <div slot="actions">
            <DiscordButtons>
                <DiscordButton type="primary">haha funny button</DiscordButton>
            </DiscordButtons>
        </div>
    </DiscordMessage>
</DiscordMessages>
```
<DiscordMessages>
    <DiscordMessage author="Guide Bot" avatar="red" bot>
        <div slot="interactions">
            <DiscordInteraction author="Guide Man" avatar="green" command>button</DiscordInteraction>
        </div>
        button go brrr
        <div slot="actions">
            <DiscordButtons>
                <DiscordButton type="primary">haha funny button</DiscordButton>
            </DiscordButtons>
        </div>
    </DiscordMessage>
</DiscordMessages>
