## What is Pycord?
Pycord is a modern, easy to use, feature-rich, and async ready API wrapper for Discord, written in Python. Pycord is a maintained fork of [discord.py](https://github.com/Rapptz/discord.py) that helps you create Discord bots with Python.

* Packages
* Conditionals
* Loops
* Classes
* Object-Oriented Programming
