Before Discord added slash commands, all bots had prefixed commands. A user would type `!ping` or `?ping` or whatever the bot's prefix was to get a response.
However, this prefixed commands system isn't native to Discord! Developers made use of the `on_message` event to check if the message began with a `!ping`. So every time a message was sent, the bot would check if it began with the prefix, or with the command name.

The syntax becomes a little more complicated when you want to have multiple commands. There are several more disadvances to this system. This is where the commands extension comes in.
`ext.commands` has various advantages, such as:

- Simpler syntax
- Easier to use
- Easier to parse user input
- Comes with built-in help commands
- Comes with a built-in system for categorizing commands

            return

        msg = message.content.split(" ", 2)
        title = msg[1]

        await message.channel.send("**{}**\n{}".format(title, content))

    elif message.content.startswith("!"):
        await message.channel.send("Unknown command.")

:::tip

You can do much more with the commands extension! This example only showcases the same features as the previous example. You can use a different built-in help command, or even create your own! You will learn about creating Help Commands and Categories in the next tutorials.

## Syntax

Before we check out the syntax, let's take a look at the bot classes.

> `discord.Client` - Contains only events.
>
> `discord.Bot` - Subclasses `discord.Client`, adds commands.
>
> `discord.ext.commands.Bot` - Subclasses `discord.Bot`, adds prefixed commands, cogs, and more.

This means that `discord.ext.commands.Bot` has both slash commands and prefixed commands, as well as events, cogs and more.

Now let's look at the syntax.

```python
import discord
from discord.ext import commands # Import the commands extension
# discord.ext.commands is not the same as discord.commands!

bot = commands.Bot(command_prefix="!") # You can change the command prefix to whatever you want.

@bot.command() # This is the decorator we use to create a prefixed command.
async def ping(ctx): # This is the function we will use to create the command.
    await ctx.send("Pong!") # This is the response the bot will send.


bot.run("token") # Run the bot with your token.
```

      You can also type !help category for more info on a category.

The help command is a built-in command and is enabled by default. You will learn more about it in the next tutorials.

## Parameters

Prefixed commands can take parameters, just like slash commands. You can specify the parameters in the function itself.

```python {2}
@bot.command()
async def echo(ctx, *, message):
    await ctx.send(message)
```

`ctx` is the context of the message. `*` means that the parameter can be any number of words. `message` is the parameter. If you had not passed `*`, `message` would only have been one word.
For example, if a user had passed `!echo hello world`, `message` would have been `hello`. Since we passed `*`, `message` is `hello world`, or the rest of the message.

We can pass multiple parameters too!

```python
@bot.command()
async def echo(ctx, channel:discord.TextChannel, title, *, message):
    await channel.send("**{}**\n{}".format(title, message))
```

In the example above, `channel` is a parameter that is of type `discord.TextChannel`. When you specify the type of the parameter, Pycord will automatically try to convert the parameter to that type. That is why you are able to use `channel.send` directly without needing to convert it first.

We also have a new parameter, the `title`. This does not have a type, so it will be a string. `*` means that the rest of the message belongs to the next parameter, in this case, `message`.

When a user types `!echo #general Greetings! Hello World!`, `channel` will be the text channel `#general`, `title` will be `Greetings!` and `message` will be `Hello World!`.

Let's take an example where the user passes `!echo #general Holiday Greetings! Greetings to you all!`. Here, the user wants the title to be "Holiday Greetings!" and the message to be "Greetings to you all!". However, since Pycord parses the message at whitespaces, the title will end up being "Holiday" and the message "Greetings! Greetings to you all!". The user can prevent this by typing `!echo "Holiday Greetings!" Greetings to you all!`.

<DiscordMessages>
  <DiscordMessage author="Guide User" avatar="blue">
    !echo #general Holiday Greetings! Greetings to you all!
  </DiscordMessage>
  <DiscordMessage author="Guide Bot" avatar="red" bot>
    <strong>Holiday</strong>
    <br />
    Greetings! Greetings to you all!
  </DiscordMessage>
  <DiscordMessage author="User 2" avatar="green">
    !echo #general "Holiday Greetings!" Greetings to you all!
  </DiscordMessage>
  <DiscordMessage author="Guide Bot" avatar="red" bot>
    <strong>Holiday Greetings!</strong>
    <br />
    Greetings to you all!
  </DiscordMessage>
</DiscordMessages>

Let's check out another example for parameters and parameter types.

```python
import random

@bot.command()
async def gtn(ctx, guess:int):
    number = random.randint(1, 10)
    if guess == number:
        await ctx.send("You guessed it!)
    else:
        await ctx.send("Nope! Better luck next time :)")
```

If you had not specified the type of the parameter, it would have been a string. And since "5" is not the same as 5 in python, the bot would have responded with "Nope! Better luck next time :)". Even if you do not specify the type of the parameter, you can still convert it later on, in this case, with `int(guess)`.
