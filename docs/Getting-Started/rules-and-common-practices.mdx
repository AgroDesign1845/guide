# Rules and Common Practices of Creating a Bot

When creating almost anything, there's always a certain set of rules to follow or common practices,
such as [PEP8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) for Python. This applies for creating bots
with Pycord as well.

:::note

Most of these rules and common practices are only applicable for verified bots, but it's good to
follow them nonetheless.

:::

## Rules

There are rules for creating bots, and most of these are required by Discord themselves, not us at
Pycord. Not following these rules may get your bot denied for verification.

### Terms of Service and Privacy Policy

Starting at some point in time, Discord has made providing a privacy policy with your bot a requirement.
This is so that Discord knows exactly what you are doing with its users' data.

:::tip
You don't need a lawyer or anyone special to write out a privacy policy for you, nor do you need
it approved by some official entity. Simply writing out how you are going to use Discord user
information in a neat way is enough.
:::

Providing a Terms of Service for your bot is optional, though usually a best practice. It tells users
what they can and cannot do with your service, and makes it easier to settle disputes if someone 
disagrees with you.

### Developer Policy

We could list almost every rule about using Discord's API here. *Or* we could simply link Discord's
developer policy to make it easier on us. You can find Discord's developer policy
[here](https://discord.com/developers/docs/policy). This outlines what you can and cannot do with
Discord's developer API. And, don't worry, it's completely readable and understandable.

## Best Practices

Now, here's something we *can't* simply link an article for. We're going to discuss the best practices
of creating a Discord bot with Pycord.

### Bot Sharding

To any new or maybe even experienced bot developer, sharding a bot sounds beneficial once you hear 
about it. I'm here to tell you that it isn't a good idea to shard your bot.

*Wait a minute, why would it be an option if it wasn't a good idea?* It's simple. I lied. Sort of.
I'm not going to go into the details of sharding a bot, so you can read about it on
[this page](../Popular-Topics/sharding). Basically, though, sharding is the process of taking your bot
and breaking it up into small pieces so it's easier to perform tasks. This is very useful for large
bots, as it makes them faster and more reliable. Sharding is not a good practice for small bots.

:::note
Discord will notify you once it is time to shard your bot, and will eventually force you to do so.
:::

At the very least, wait for one thousand servers to shard your bot. If you shard your bot while it's
small, you'll just be wasting resources and possibly making your bot slower.

### Verification

Verifying your Discord bot is something every developer would like to achieve. It shows that your bot
is in more than 75 servers. It's generally a good idea to try to get your bot verified as soon as
possible. We're talking at 76 servers soon. This is because Discord can be somewhat slow in terms of
bot verification, so verifying as soon as possible gives them enough time to verify before your bot
reaches the 100 server cap. If a bot is not verified, it cannot grow beyong 100 servers.

It's also a good idea to only apply for the privileged intents that you need. Applying for intents
your bot doesn't use wastes both your time and Discord's time, as your whole verification request
can be denied simply because you applied for an intent you didn't need.

### Subclassing

While it may take some time, subclassing a bot is very worth it. Once again, this was explained 
elsewhere so I won't go into the details, but I felt it fit here so I put it here.

Subclassing a bot makes it more flexible and allows it to do a lot more. Read more about subclassing
bots [here](../Popular-Topics/subclassing-bots)

### Your Bot's Token

Your bot is only able to be run for one reason: its token. If you followed the 
[guide for creating your first bot](creating-your-first-bot), you should already know a bit about
keeping that token safe. That's exactly what you want to do.

Sharing your token is never good. If someone evil gets a hold of your token, they can do terrible things,
such as making your bot leave all of its servers, spamming all of the members the bot has contact with,
and even manipulating the servers the bot is in, if given the permissions. That's why it's very important
to keep your token safe. To learn how to do so, read [this part](creating-your-first-bot#tokens) of
the Creating Your First Bot guide.

### Backups

You always want to back up your bot's data. This includes both its code *and* its databases. This way,
if something tragic happens, such as your host failing a data migration or you breaking your Raspberry
Pi's SD card that held your bot, you'll still have its precious user data. I have a small program for
my bot that uploads its databases to a remote GitHub repository every now and then to not lose any data.
It may be smarter to find a bit more of a reliable way to do so, though.

Public or private, having a local Git repository connected to a remote one is a good idea for making
almost any application. For a lot of developers, it's like saving your work. If you do this, all of
your bot's code won't be lost if your computer spontaneously combusts or you smash it to bits from 
anger. You can simply grab the back-up computer that everyone has laying around and you're back
in business.
