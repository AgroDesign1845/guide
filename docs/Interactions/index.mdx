# Discord Interactions

Back in the December of 2020, Discord released their first interaction: the slash command. This was
the beginning to a great deal of amazing Message Components and Application Commands in Discord.
Since then, Discord also added:

- Buttons
- Select Menus
- Text Modals
- Message commands
- User Commands

Buttons, Select Menus, and Text Modals fall under the `Message Components` category, while Slash
Commands, Message Commands, and User Commands fall under the `Application Commands` category. Keep
reading to find out more about Message Components and Application Commands and why they're useful for
your application, as well as the pros and cons of using them.

## Message Components

Message Components are fairly new features in Discord, allowing developers to give their bots a fast 
and understandable user interface to their bot. Message Components are easy to use and make your bot
look modern, sleek, and downright awesome.

### Buttons

Buttons are the first of the Message Components. They allow for quick responses to prompts, such as 
a "cancel" or "continue" button. Of course, these aren't the only uses. People have created awesome
things with buttons, such as calculators, games, and more!

<DiscordMessages>
  <DiscordMessage author="Guide Bot" avatar="red" bot>
    Discord buttons are awesome!
    <div slot="actions">
      <DiscordButtons>
        <DiscordButton type="primary">ðŸ˜Ž Click me!</DiscordButton>
      </DiscordButtons>
    </div>
  </DiscordMessage>
</DiscordMessages>

This is what a Button looks like. Very simple and modern. To learn more about buttons, refer to our
(buttons page)[buttons.mdx].

### Select Menus

Select Menus are the second of Discord's Message Components. They allow for quick choices by the
user that your bot can use. Select Menus are good for things such as choosing features, pages of a 
help menu, and more.

[Insert Select Menu example]

This is what a Select Menu looks like. While not looking as good as Buttons, they still look great
and have even greater possibilities. To learn more about Select Menus, please refer to our (Select
Menus page)[dropdowns.mdx].

### Text Modals

Text Modals are the most recent Message Component in Discord. They're useful for text input and
filling out forms such as a sign-up for your bot's service. These are meant to replace long bot setup
processes by allowing users to fill out a form, as well as replace having to make the user send 
messages that the bot uses in general. Due to the upcoming (Message Content Intent)[topics/intents.mdx],
verified bots will be forced to use Discord's new Interaction system instead of messages. Text Modals
are opened by clicking on a button.

[Text Modal example?]

This is what a Text Modal looks like. Easy to use and one of the most useful Message Components yet.

### Views

Views are not an Application Command nor are they a Message Component. Views are the invisible
placeholders or grid that Message Components lie in. Views can have up to 5 `Action Rows`. `Action
Rows` can have a maximum of 5 slots. Below you can find a table of how many slots a Message 
Interaction takes up.

| Component    | Slots                        |
| ------------------------------------------- |
| Buttons      | 1 Slot                       |
| Select Menus | 5 Slots                      |
| Text Modals  | 1 Slot (opened via a button) |

So, based on this, you could have a maximum of 25 buttons in a View with no Select Menus and 5 Select
Menus with no Buttons in a View. This doesn't mean you can't have them both in a View. You can have
a combination, such as 20 Buttons and a Select Menu or 10 Buttons and 3 Select Menus. 

## Application Commands

Application Commands are also a new feature to Discord, that allow with easier ways to use commands
that don't compromise Discord safety and privacy. Application Commands are easy to add to your bot
and give users an easier and safer way to use commands.

### Slash Commands

Slash Commands were the first Discord Interaction. Slash Commands are easy to use and create. They
allow for an alternative to prefix commands without the need for the message content intent.

::: note

Preferring prefix commands over Application Commands are **not** a valid reason to apply for the
message content Privileged Intent. Using this as a reason will get your application denied.

:::

<DiscordMessages>
  <DiscordMessage author="Guide Bot" avatar="red" bot>
    <div slot="interactions">
      <DiscordInteraction author="Guide Man" avatar="green" command>
        ping
      </DiscordInteraction>
    </div>
    Pong! Latency is 335ms.
  </DiscordMessage>
</DiscordMessages>

<br />

This is what a slash command looks like. Very simple, not very different from a normal command other
than the note telling you who used the command. Slash Commands support fields for the following:

- Members
- Roles
- Attachments
- Text

Just about as good as it gets.

### Message and User Commands

Message Commands and User Commands were both introduced around the same time, and are very similar to
each other, so we'll be introducing them together. These commands are found in the `apps` tab when
alt-clicking. The only difference between the two is that Message Commands only appear in the apps tab
of a message, while User Commands are only found in the apps tab of a user. Message Commands are
useful for having function to report a message, warn a user for that message, and more. User Commands
are useful for having a function to add a user to a ticket, warn a user, and more.

This is a Message Command:

And this is a User Command:

Pretty cool, right? To learn more about these two, please read the (Message and User Commands guide)
