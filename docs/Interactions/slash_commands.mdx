# About
Discord implemented slash commands as an easier, faster, more efficent, and cooler way of using commands.
Pycord has implemented slash commands into the library in a professional, efficent, and easy manner, which will be showcased here.

## Basics

Shown below is a basic ping slash command.

```py
import discord

# discord.Bot removes the required prefix param of commands.Bot
bot = discord.Bot(debug_guilds=[...])  # since global slash commands can take up to an hour to register 
# we have to limit the guilds for testing.

@bot.command()  # makes a slash command
async def ping(ctx):
    await ctx.respond("pong!")  # respond to the slash command

bot.run("my_bot_token")
```

<DiscordMessages>
    <DiscordMessage author="Guide Bot" avatar="red" bot>
        <div slot="interactions">
            <DiscordInteraction author="Guide Man" avatar="green" command>ping</DiscordInteraction>
        </div>
        pong!
    </DiscordMessage>
</DiscordMessages>
