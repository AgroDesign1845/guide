# Text Modals

Text modals, also known as "modals" or "text inputs", are Discord's answer for getting text input from
users. Instead of waiting for someone to send a message, bots can now wait for someone to fill out a 
form that gets returned to the bot. 

Modals were released because of the upcoming
[Message Content Privileged Intent](../Popular-Topics/intents), which requires whitelisting.
Discord would not accept "getting content from messages" as a reason for whitelisting.
