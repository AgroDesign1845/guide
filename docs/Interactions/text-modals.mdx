# Text Modals

Text modals, also known as "modals" or "text inputs", are Discord's answer for getting text input from
users. Instead of waiting for someone to send a message, bots can now wait for someone to fill out a 
form that gets returned to the bot. 

Modals are one of the latest interactions from Discord, being released due to the upcoming
[Message Content Privileged Intent](../Popular-Topics/intents). Soon, this will be the only way for
bots that aren't whitelisted for this intent to get text input, other than direct messages and bot
mentions.
