# About

On [Insert date], Discord added their second message component: Select Menus. Select Menus allow users
to choose from a list of items sent by a bot. These are a great substitute for having a user send a 
number that corresponds to an option. You can even allow users to select multiple options from Select
Menus. This guide will show you the easy and painless ways of using them with Pycord.

## Concept

Select Menus aren't the only message component in Discord. There are also (Buttons)[buttons.mdx] and
(Text Modals)[modals.mdx]. Select Menus make it easy for users to pick one or multiple options from
a list provided by a bot.
